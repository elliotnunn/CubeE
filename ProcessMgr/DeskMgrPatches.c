	Change History (most recent first):
	 
	  <SM21>	 7/21/93	joe		Backed out <SM20>.
		<19>	11/17/91	YK		Modify code for the Text Services Manager in c_systemevent to
									support apps which set SEvtEnb flag off.
		<18>	 11/1/91	DTY		Use the system override map in FILE_NOT_IN_SYSTEM_MAP instead of
									SYSMAPHANDLE.
		<17>	10/15/91	YK		Added code for the Text Services Manager in c_systemevent.
		<16>	  3/7/91	DFH		stb, #84365: Fixed CoreLaunchDeskAccessory to deal with file
									spec ptr == nil and driver name ptr == nil. Was calling
									OpenDeskAcc ROM with nil name pointer.
		<15>	  3/7/91	DFH		stb, #84195: Tuned sleep limiters to have a floor driver delay.
									Greedy drivers were zeroing out the sleep period, causing the
									front application to hog the CPU from the other applications.
		<14>	  3/5/91	DFH		dnf, WS#DFH-910305a: Fixed LaunchDeskAccessory so that it can be
									called when the DA itself is the current process.
		<13>	 1/28/91	DFH		JSM,#81425: Removed inhibit_DAs mechanism that used to prevent
									SystemEvent and SystemTask call-throughs while in MenuSelect.
									There was no need for it, and it caused problems for drivers
									during prolonged SystemMenu (e.g. Help menu's ModalDialog).
		<12>	 1/21/91	DFH		(KSM) Process Menu is now called Application Menu.
		<10>	  1/8/91	DFH		(stb) Fixed LimitFrontSleepForDriversSake and
									LimitBackSleepForDriversSake to work correctly when dCtlDelay is
									0.
		 <9>	  1/8/91	DFH		(ewa) Fixed CoreLaunchDeskAccessory() bug where retval was not
									being set.
		 <8>	12/18/90	DFH		Changed SystemEvent patch to give high-level debugger key even
									if that debugger is pCurrentProcess.
		 <7>	12/17/90	DFH		Rename CheckForCutCopy to CheckForCutCopyMenuKey.
		 <6>	12/14/90	DFH		Added SynchIdleTime call in c_systemtask.
		 <5>	12/10/90	DFH		Compiler bug workaround in c_sysedit.  Use SCRAPCOUNT += 1
									instead of SCRAPCOUNT++.
		 <4>	 12/5/90	DFH		Driver scheduling now affects application sleep time, not vice
									versa.
		 <3>	11/30/90	DFH		Fixed PEntryFromFileSpec call in CoreLaunchDeskAccessory to pass
									pDASpec->daFileSpec instead of &fileSpec.  This bug prevented
									LaunchDeskAccessory from bringing forward an already open DA.
		 <0>	  9/2/86	ELR		New Today.

/* c_systemtask. A patch for SystemTask. Do nothing unless the calling process and

 * be even be up when coercionState == CS_DONE?).  We can call the original routine
 * only if the current app is the frontmost, since the cursor handling and notification
 * manager rely on the WINDOWLIST to contain the active window.  If the current app is
 * not frontmost, we do the remaining part of the original routine.  Currently, this
 * only means giving control calls to the needs-time drivers.
 * NOTE: We disallow switching so we don't get screwed up by DA's that make event calls
 * (we could end up back here, and call them again, resulting in an infinite loop).
 * NOTE:  We bracket the call with BeginSystemMode/EndSystemMode so that files opened
 * by permanent system drivers are not closed when an app quits.  Unfortunately, this
 * is not quite bombproof because some "permanent drivers" (like QuickMail) are really
 * DAs that make event calls, which gives another app the chance to die.  ExitToShell
 * necessarily resets the SystemModeLevel to 0.  A file opened later in the same
 * control call would be tracked.  This shouldn't screw up legitimate users of system
 * mode, tho, because of the rule that it not be in effect over an event call.
 * NOTE: Have to set up CURRENTA5 because of case where a DA might bring up an
 * alert.  The problem is that if the alert causes any kind of event for one
 * of the underlying app's dialog windows, which might have a user item
 * installed and the user item might expect A5 == CURRENTA5.
