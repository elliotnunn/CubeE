	Change History (most recent first):
	 
		<22>	10/28/92	DTY		Use new Get/Set macros to access ExpandMem.
		<20>	 9/11/92	DRF		Take out “while(FSBUSY);” in “TheFuture” to allow for faster
									switching.
		<19>	 8/26/92	DTY		Roll in latest changes for A/UX.
		<18>	 3/30/92	DTY		#1025416,<DDG>: Tell Skia to switch it’s globals on a context
									switch.
		<17>	 3/23/92	JSM		OSEvents.h is obsolete, use Events.h.
		<16>	 2/18/92	DTY		#1021226: Switch emMessageManagerGlobals again.
		<15>	 10/4/91	JSM		Change PsychoticFarmerOrLater conditionals to TheFuture.
		<14>	 9/22/91	DTY		Change PsychoticFarmerAndLater to PsychoticFarmerOrLater.
		<13>	 9/13/91	DTY		Conditionalise previous change so it doesn’t get built for
									CubeE. (It’ll get built for PsychoticFarmerAndLater.)
		<12>	  6/4/91	DFH		Switch emMessageManagerGlobals.
		<11>	 1/28/91	DFH		JSM,#81425:Include MFPrivate.h, since that's where
									DisableSwitching and EnableSwitching are now.
		<10>	 1/18/91	DFH		(ewa) Fix kill_vbl check of VBL record address. Was checking the
									wrong element.
		 <9>	 1/15/91	DFH		(VL) Conditionalize out the AUX switch prototypes.
		 <8>	 1/14/91	DFH		(JDR) Conditionalize out AUX support.
		 <6>	12/19/90	gbm		(dba) Fix off-by-one bug in an A/UX change. Also kill VBLs
		 							whose queue entries are in an application’s heap as well
									as those whose task pointers are.
		 <5>	 12/5/90	DFH		Integrated AUX support.
		 <4>	 11/6/90	DFH		Renamed emAppleEventsGlobal to emAppleEvents.
		 <3>	 11/1/90	DFH		Unconditionalized edition mgr lomem switch.
		 <0>	  9/2/86	ELR		New Today.
