 Overview:
	
 These routines are linked into the PACK2 (Disk Init) resource, and thus at present are
 only available via the DIBadMount function.  DIBadMount calls DIVerify as it always has,
 and if the latter returns a good status the disk is presumed to be perfect and disk
 initialization proceeds without calling these routines.  But if DIVerify returns a bad
 status, then the following happens:
	
 1. diBadBlockPass1 is called, which will manually re-verify the disk by writing and reading
    test patterns to every track, building a list of bad tracks.  If too many badspots are found,
    if one of the crucial sectors such as the boot blocks are found to be bad, or if we suspect
    drive problems rather than media failure, diBadBlockPass1 returns a bad status and
    initialization fails.
	
 2. DIZero is called, to write a blank HFS directory to the disk.  DIZero is not told
    about the bad spots.  If Pass 1 has done its job, DIZero won't touch any bad spots
    and so it won't notice the disk is imperfect, but if we blow it and DIZero gets
    a bad status, the disk won't initialize but no serious harm is done.
	
 3. diBadBlockPass2 is called with the list of bad extents.  It removes the bad blocks from
    the bitmap, adjusts the MDB, and puts the extents in the extent B*-tree, but a catalog
    node for the bad-block "file" is not created.
	
 Because there is no catalog entry for the bad-block file, it is completely invisible
 to users and to logical disk and directory manipulation.  Fortunately, the HFS mount-
 volume routine will respect the bad-block extents in the B*-tree even though there is
 no catalog entry.
 
 To identify imperfect disks, we set the 0x0200 ("vcbAtBB") volume attribute bit in the MDB.
 The bad extents are described in the B*-tree with reserved file-ID 5 ("fsBBCNID").
 
 Note that these routines are intimately aware of the internal structure of HFS volumes,
 and do not use any of the HFS subroutines.  Thus this module is sure to break if the file
 format or even arbitrary decisions made by 'DiskInitHFS.a' change.  In addition, testing
 is done a track at a time, which means that this module is also aware of disk geometry.
 We do this both for speed -- the floppy drivers xfer the whole track anyway -- and because
 experience has shown that if a track has any imperfections, its best to avoid it completely.
 See "diNextTrack", which is set up in such a way that even if we get the geometry wrong
 the algorithms still work, albeit less efficiently.
 
 We limit the number of badspot extents to "MAXBAD", where an extent is an arbitrarily large set
 of contiguous sectors.  This is because we allocate fixed-size arrays for simplicity, and also
 because we don't bother to split B*-tree nodes when hiding the bad extents in the extent B*-tree.
 MAXBAD is set to the max number of extents that will fit in a single 512-byte block.  In practice
 this is not a problem; after coallescing, there are rarely more than a few bad extents.
 
 On the other hand, these routines will handle arbitrarily large disks (and thus bitmaps),
 and although the sector size is wired in with the "SECTOR_xxx" defines, it will be pretty
 easy to make these variables rather than constants.  Note, however, that in practice the
 floppy disks that are actually operated on have blocksize equal to sectorsize, and also
 are small enough that their bitmaps are only one sector long.  Thus the more complex cases
 will probably never have been executed/tested as you read this.
 
 Notation:
 
 	sector == Physical block, as defined by the driver.  In HFS, these are assumed to
	 	  be 512 bytes long ("SECTOR_BYTES").
	
	block  == Allocation block, or unit of HFS allocation.  These are always a multiple
		  of sectors, set so that the number of blocks on a device will not overflow a
		  16-bit field.  In practice, the number of sectors per block on the floppies
		  that these routines actually deal with is always one, since they don't have
		  more than 2**16 sectors, but we don't rely on this.

 Test a group of sectors with a given pattern.  A test consists of writing the test pattern to
 the sectors, reading it back in, and checking to see that we read in the correct data.  We
 assume that the passed buffer has been initialized with the test pattern, and always leave the
 buffer as we found it.  The result of our test is returned in "iopp->ioResult", and will be
 "noErr" if the test was passed, or any of several I/O or internally-generated errors on
 failure.  The parameter block we are passed is assumed to be set up with the proper ioVRefNum,
 ioRefNum, ioBuffer, and ioPosMode (ie, "from start").  In addition to the I/O errors returned by
 the driver, we add two of our own:
 
 	BAD_DATA	Both the read and the write returned "noErr", but the data read was
			not correct.  Unlikely, as the sectors are protected with CRC checksums,
			but driver bugs and parity errors in RAM can cause this to happen.
		
	SOFT_ERRORS	Both tha read and the write returned "noErr", and the data read was
			correct, but the driver reported one or more "soft" (correctible)
			errors.
 
 We actually read the test pattern twice, once normally and once in verify mode, due to rumors
 that some 3rd-party drivers do not support the verify function but simply return "noErr".
 Also, its good to try several times, in case there's a latent error.

 ***********************
 
 Called for each group of sectors that are "bad".  We decide whether they are critical, in the
 sense that a sector has special meaning and cannot simply be hidden in the extent B*-tree.
 We also declare a sector critical if it is touched by "DiskInitHFS.a", as that routine is called
 *before* diBadBlockPass2, and thus before we can hide the bad blocks.  The critical sectors are
 as follows, starting at 0:
 	the 2 boot sector
	the master directory (MDB) sector
	the sectors that the bitmap will be written to
	the initial extent of the Extent B*-tree
	the initial extent of the Catalog B*-tree
 Thus, if the bitmap is 'b' sectors long, and each of the B*-tree initial extents are 'e' sectors
 long, then the first '2+1+b+2e' sectors are critical.
 
 Note that we don't check for the sector the alternate copy of the MDB is written to, which is the
 2nd from the end of the disk.  This is because experience has shown that on floppies
 the last track is the most error prone by far, and if we insisted that it be perfect too many
 disks would be rejected.  So we stop testing at the last sector in the allocatable region of the
 disk.  Then, "diBadBlockPass1" tests the alternate MDB sector individually, and tolerates
 soft errors in this test.
 
 We return true if any sector in the group is critical.
