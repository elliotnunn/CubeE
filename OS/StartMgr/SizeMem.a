;	Change History (most recent first):
;
;	  <SM49>	12/13/93	PN		Roll in KAOs and Horror changes to support Malcom and AJ
;									machines.
;	  <SM48>	11/19/93	KW		copied HMCMerge EDisk calculations and put in OrwellMerge.  Only
;									effects the CygnusX1 ROM
;	  <SM47>	11/17/93	chp		Put back TNT code inadvertantly removed by a previous checkin.
;	  <SM46>	11/17/93	KW		added some forSTP601 conditionals.  Only effects CygnusX1 ROM
;	  <SM45>	11/13/93	SAM		Roll in <MC10> from mc900ftjesus.
;	  <MC10>	11/13/93	SAM		In the EDisk calculation from the previous revision, I was not
;									anticipating the result going negative. It does. I now check for
;									it.;	  <SM44>	11/12/93	SAM		Roll in <MC9> from mc900ftjesus.
;	   <MC9>	11/12/93	SAM		When allocating an EDisk, make sure there is KminHeap (or
;									somesuch) free or don't allocate.    The ammount of RAM
;									allocated for the edisk is stored beyond the diagnostic longs at
;									the end of the chunk table.  InitMMU uses this size for eMMU
;									machines.
;	  <SMG2>	 11/9/93    fau     Added the TNT Decoder support (HammerHead)
;	  <SM42>	 11/9/93	KW		added some conditional forSTP601.  Only used for CygnusX1 ROM
;	  <SM41>	 11/7/93	SAM		Roll in <MC8> from mc900ftjesus.
;	   <MC8>	 11/7/93	SAM		Keep a running total of RAM allocated by the nanokernel in the
;									chunk table.
;	  <SM40>	 11/6/93	SAM		Roll in <MC7> from mc900ftjesus.
;	   <MC7>	 11/6/93	SAM		Disable Sonora video before mucking with the NanoKernel memory
;									allocation.
;	  <SM39>	 11/1/93	SAM		Roll in <MC6> from mc900ftjesus.
;	   <MC6>	 11/1/93	SAM		(RC) HMCMerge now checks PRAM for the diag burn-in sig as well
;									as reading the monitor sense lines for the RBV to determine if a
;									DRAM based frame buffer should be allocated.
;	  <SM38>	10/16/93	SAM		Roll in <MC5> from mc900ftjesus.
;	   <MC5>	10/16/93	SAM		Add some slop to the RBV buffer for PDM to account for QD
;									writing past the end of the buffer. (Doesn't this seem like a
;									problem to you?  Does to me...)
;	  <SM37>	10/15/93	SAM		Roll in <MC4> from mc900ftjesus.
;	   <MC4>	10/15/93	SAM		Ok, I fixed the boot beep code, so the RBV size is now set to a
;									max of 600k (not 768).  Removed the 3 extra longs allocated in
;									the chunk table (for debugging).
;	  <SM36>	 9/29/93	SAM		For PDM: from mc900ftjesus.
;	   <MC3>	 9/25/93	SAM		For PDM: Loose Evt1 support.
;	  <SM35>	 9/13/93	SAM		For PDM (HMC): Removed the Edisk hack for the nanokernel.
;									Marked all the DMA buffers noncacheable.
;	  <SM34>	  9/9/93	pdw		Added 'nk' onto front of MakePageWriteThrough.
;	  <SM33>	 8/23/93	SAM		Added a temp hack to increase the amount of RAM allocated for
;									the RAM disk by 1 page (nk bug)
;	  <SM32>	 8/23/93	SAM		Changed the alignment restriction for the EDisk allocation to be
;									4k.
;	  <SM31>	 8/23/93	SAM		Added some space in the HMC chunk table for a couple of
;									warmstart longs.
;	  <SM30>	 8/12/93	KW		adding two more smurf wombats
;	  <SM29>	 8/11/93	KW		added some branches based on new smurf boxes
;	  <SM28>	 6/14/93	kc		Roll in Ludwig.
;	   <LW4>	  6/4/93	fau		In sizing memory in Cyclone, there was a bug when a Wide Mode
;									SIMM was in bank 5, no SIMM in bank 7, and a Standard Mode SIMM
;									in Bank 0.  Bug #1088829.
;	  <SM27>	  6/3/93	SAM		For HMC machines (PDM) if an evt2 or better is found, the floppy
;									and serial DMA buffers are marked noncacheable in order fix a
;									data path snooping during DMA bug.
;	  <SM26>	  5/9/93	SAM		Added a couple lines of crucial code to the PDM physical buffer
;									allocation code.  Grin.
;	  <SM25>	  5/6/93	SAM		For PDM.  Changed the HMC entry in the sizemem "split" table to
;									point directly at the HMCMerge routine (we don't have to size
;									anything, really).  Addded allocation of the DMA and video frame
;									physical buffers to HMCMerge.  Added code to make the frame
;									buffer write-through cacheable.
;	  <SM24>	 4/30/93	SAM		Removed non-functional non-universal forRomulator code in
;									SizeBanks (<LW2>).  Added one more forSmurf condo.
;	  <SM23>	 4/19/93	SAM		Added forSmurf conditionals around RiscWombat boxflag check
;									(ugh).
;	  <SM22>	 3/31/93	chp		Synchronize SuperMario with changes from <LW2>.
;	  <SM21>	 3/11/93	SAM		Added EDisk allocation to HMC merge code.
;	   <LW2>	 2/26/93	fau		Removed Cyclone EVT3 (MMC) support.
;	  <SM20>	 2/25/93	RC		Fixed Merge code for Smurf.  Old code did not do what we thought
;									it did, but now it correctly sizes memory by using the same code
;									and PDM uses.
;	  <SM19>	 2/20/93	SAM		Added emuWarmStartConst to the chunk table build for HMC
;									machines.
;	  <SM18>	  2/5/93	SAM		Added HMC "merge" code that conconcts a fake chunk table and
;									generally does the right thing.  (for PDM).
;	  <SM17>	12/23/92	RC		Added Support for Smurf
;	  <SM16>	 12/1/92	EH		Changed PrattAddr reference to DecoderAddr reference for
;									PrattMerge.
;	  <SM15>	 12/1/92	EH		Added code for Pratt memory controller.
;	  <SM14>	11/12/92	rab		Added djMEMCSplit to the split table (had added the code but
;									forgot the entry). Also exported SizeSoundBuffer for MMUTable.a.
;	  <SM13>	11/10/92	GD		Fixed some "forRomulator" issues from latest Horror roll-in.
;	  <SM12>	 11/3/92	rab		Roll in Horror changes. <H16>10/13/92 BG Modified various
;									comments in the djMEMCSplit code to indicate that both WLCD and
;									Primus need to set the OneBufferedBus bit. <H15> 9/28/92 BG
;									Changed the djMEMCMerge code so that if you are trying to create
;									a ReAnimator type ROM, don't turn on memory interleaving. <H14>
;									8/4/92 SWC Fixed a bug in MSCMerge: we were only allocating
;									enough space for 5 RAM banks (we support 8), so the end of the
;									RAM chunk table was going into write-only RAM.
;	 		<H13> 7/13/92	SWC		Added some code to the end of MergeDone to move the RAM chunk
;									table below a sound buffer in high RAM. This was moved here from
;									MMUTables.a because (1) since the chunk table was moved down
;									after running StartTest, we'd lose the warmstart flag (causes
;									the RAM disk to get trashed on Restart, and (2) diagnostics seem
;									to call SizeMem in several places, so I figured it was better to
;									get everything set up once.
;	  		<H10> 6/16/92	BG		Added back in the interleave initialization for djMEMC.
;									However, a precursor check has been added to only allow that
;									code to be executed if the version number of djMEMC is greater
;									than 0, since version 0 parts will cause Wombat/WLCD to die
;									shortly after enabling interleaving.
;			<H8> 6/12/92	BG		Added support for sizing up to 16 banks of memory. This is
;									needed because Wombat can support up to 10 banks. Also - removed
;									the djMEMC configuration register initialization from here and
;									moved it to UniversalPatch.a so that it is not executed multiple
;									times (since SizeMemory gets called multiple times).
;			<H7>	 6/9/92	BG		Added djMEMC memory controller to split and merge tables, as
;									well as the split and merge code. However, changes to SizeBanks
;									are also required that have not been fully tested on all
;									machines yet, so that did _not_ get rolled in.
;			<H6> 5/20/92	NJV		Fixed register-trashing bug in SonoraMerge.
;			<H5> 5/19/92	SWC		Modified @MSCSplit and MSCMerge to temporarily support both MSC2
;									and MSC3 while we make the transition.
;       	<H4> 5/12/92	HY		Roll-in LC II changes.  Change the sizing routine for VISA 
;									decoders to support 2 or 4MB on PCB.
;			<H3>  5/4/92	JC		Change Sonora split so that Bank 0 has 4 Megs of RAM installed.
;			<H2> 4/13/92	JC		Remove references to SonoraAddr (is going away) and replaced
;									with references to RBVAddr for Sonora based machines.
;	  <SM11>	10/22/92	fau		Added support for the YMCA Decoder in standard and wide mode.
;									This involved adding a new YMCASize banks.  Added a check to
;									SizeBank to make sure we didn't spin forever if the ram bank end
;									is not a multiple of 2^(n-1) * chunksize.  (This will occur when
;									sizing wide memory as standard memory).  Also, changed the use
;									of MMC/YMCAExists and MMC/YMCAAddr to use the decoder info.
;	  <SM10>	10/18/92	CCH		Added support for HMC decoder.
;	   <SM9>	 9/30/92	fau		Incorporated support for the YMCA decoder that is found in
;									Cyclone EVT4.  This included the YMCA split routine and the
;									YMCAMerge routine.  Left the support for the MMC in there.
;									Eventually, the MMC (used in previous Cyclone EVT's, should go
;									away.)
;	   <SM8>	 8/19/92	CSS		Update from Reality:
;									<23> 8/18/92 DTY	Change the name of BootGlobs to StartGlobals to avoid confusion
;														with BootGlobals, which is used by the boot code in Boot[1-3].a.
;	   <SM7>	 8/17/92	CCH		Changed orwell stitch code to use DecoderAddr field instead of
;									OrwellAddr.
;	   <SM6>	 8/11/92	kc		Don't split memory while running the ROM image in RAM on
;									Cyclone. Use A3 instead of A7 in SizeMem to make ReAnimator
;									happy.
;	   <SM5>	  8/9/92	CCH		Don't attempt to stitch memory when running on a RISC processor
;									in a Quadra.
;	   <SM4>	 7/13/92	CCH		Added conditionalized support for Cub Card on Quadras.
;	   <SM3>	 5/25/92	RB		Making Cyclone changes...Pandora/Horror comments follow: <P4>
;									5/13/92 KW (HV,H4) Roll-in LC II changes. Change the sizing
;									routine for VISA decoders to support 2 or 4MB on PCB. (JC,H3)
;									Change Sonora split so that Bank 0 has 4 Megs of RAM installed.
;									<P2> 3/4/92 RMP Changed MMCMerge to configure Bank B correctly.
;									<H5> 5/19/92 SWC Modified @MSCSplit and MSCMerge to temporarily
;									support both MSC2 and MSC3 while we make the transition.
;	   <SM2>	 5/16/92	kc		Roll in Horror and Terror Changes. Comments follow:
;	   <H13>	01/27/92	jmp 	The original contents of this file have been moved to the
;									SizeMemPatch.a file.
;		<H9>	 12/9/91	SAM 	Added a read to ROM in SizeBank between the RAM write and compare
;									to prevent a floating bus from fooling us into thinking that
;									there are 4 gigabytes of RAM built-in.
;		<H7>	 12/5/91	SAM 	Removing all special cases for built-in RAM for Vail machines
;									cuz the hardware folks decided that their klude was a kludge.
;		<H5>	 12/3/91	SAM 	Changed Sonora split/merge code to use the new SonoraVIA2
;									base address equate.
;		<H4>	11/25/91	SAM 	First attempt at the Sonora sitch routine for Vail and
;									Carnation.
;		<H3>	10/22/91	SWC 	Changed MSCAddr references to RBVAddr since MSC is just a
;									variant of the RBV.
;		<H2>	  8/5/91	SWC 	Added a fix to MSCMerge so that it works correctly if all RAM
;									banks are not filled.
;		<T9>	 6/21/91	BG		Swapped the order of the case table in SizeMemory to match the
;									(new) order of the DecoderKinds table in UniversalEqu.a.
;		<T7>	  5/1/91	HJR 	SWC - Added support for the MSC for DB-Lite.

;		<18>	  3/5/91	PN		Fix the warning by putting the END statement at the end
;		<17>	 9/24/90	GMR		Added special case to JAWS merge code to deal with 2 meg bank A,
;									0 meg bank B and vice versa when the 2 meg is in a single chunk
;									(as in TIM).
;		<16>	 9/19/90	BG		Removed 040-related kludges (EclipseNOPs).
;		<15>	  8/2/90	CCH		Clear D6 error flag after chunk table is written.
;		<14>	 7/10/90	CCH		Fixed bug in orwell merge, and modified it to create a separate
;									chunk table entry for each chunk listed in universal.a.
;		<13>	 5/10/90	GMR		Preserved reg d2 inside FMCMerge.
;		<12>	  5/3/90	GMR		Fixed file contents- ROMLister corrupted the file before
;									check-in.
;		<11>	  5/3/90	GMR		The chunk table now contains separate, contiguous chunks for
;									each bank of RAM.
;		<10>	 4/25/90	GMR		Made previous change save register A4, as before.
;		 <9>	 4/21/90	GMR		Moved ConfigureRAM functionality from StartInit.a to this file,
;									to fix problems associated with writing the chunk table before
;									the memory is stitched together. The sizing code now can size up
;									to 8 banks before storing the info in the chunk table. Added
;									Waimea splitting/stitching code to deal with it's 8 banks of
;									RAM.
;		 <8>	  4/2/90	JJ		Correct memory address used to distinguish between Elsies with 1
;									MB vs 2 MB on main logic board.

;									decoders.
;		 <5>	 2/21/90	BG		The Orwell configuration code needed a small bit of tweaking.
;		 <4>	 2/16/90	BG		Added code to initialize Orwell bank addresses to the known
;									default power-on state.
;		 <3>	 1/11/90	CCH		Added include of “HardwarePrivateEqu.a”.
;	   <2.9>	 10/9/89	GMR		NEEDED FOR ZONE5: Return bit mask for bad byte lanes, supporting
;									up to 8 banks of 4 byte lanes each. Initialize FMC to put bank B
;									on 64 Meg boundary.
;	   <2.8>	 6/30/89	GMR		Put FF's on bus between byte compare write/read cycles, to
;									eliminate stray capacitance problems when no RAM present on
;									access.
;	   <2.7>	 6/26/89	GMR		Changed to exit with a real stack pointer near low memory, top
;									element on stack contains pointer to memory chunk table at top
;									of last bank.
;	   <2.6>	 6/11/89	GGD		Converted to use RamInfo in rom tables.
;	   <2.5>	 6/11/89	GMR		Changed call to GetHardwareInfo to be a BigBSR6 so it'll reach.
;	   <2.4>	 5/30/89	GMR		Added comment describing error code returned in D6
;	   <2.3>	 5/26/89	GMR		Return error, instead of ignoring bank, if only some SIMMs in a
;									bank are present. This should make Service happy.

;	   <2.1>	 5/22/89	GMR		Corrected prep of d2 before GetHardwareInfo call, optimized a
;									few things, terminated tables with 1 long instead of 2 longs.
;	   <2.0>	 5/16/89	GMR		Rewrote entire file, returning a7 pointing to table of bank
;									entries (start,length,...,$FFFF) on all machines. It's now
;									non-destructive.
;									---------------Below doesn't apply now---------------
;==============================================================================================
;	   <1.9>	 4/28/89	rle		check startup code (now in d5) upon entry to determine if stack
;									is valid or memory needs to be tested
;	   <1.8>	 3/28/89	SES		Cleaned up code to run a bit more efficiently. Added an initial
;									browse through memory so that we can run out of Bank B only for
;									HafMac.
;	   <1.7>	  3/7/89	SES		Added code to check for warm start and PwrMgr reset before
;									running Ram test.
;	   <1.6>	 2/24/89	SES		Added code to ensure screen is clean for RBV-based machines.
;	   <1.5>	 2/23/89	SES		Mixed conditional for EXPORT BankASize to reflect what's in the
;									body of routine.
;	   <1.4>	 2/22/89	SES		Added non-destructive code back in. Added check for startup or
;									entry from booted system. Changed stack and table setup to be a
;									bit more flexible. Still need to add a search for where first
;									RAM is.
;	   <1.3>	 2/16/89	rwh		Added support for Fitch Memory Controller rev 1. When FMC2
;									arrives, may need to change these for a contiguous physical
;									memory model. Removed MvMac hack in SizeMem.
;	   <1.2>	 2/16/89	SES		Removed non-destructive code because restored values end up
;									writing via wrap into locations that haven't been checked yet.
;	   <1.1>	 2/15/89	SES		Fixed routine so that it is non-destructive. On exit, stack will
;									be set to the top of tested memory.
;	   <1.0>	 2/13/89	SES		Adding to EASE for the first time.

YMCASizeBanks
;
;	The YMCA has a separate SizeBanks routine because it supports standard and wide mode DRAM SIMMs.  (See
;	the YMCA ERS).  Wide Mode DRAMs have more rows than columns and use less power -- Wombat uses these too.
;   But, we're different and we support the standard mode, where the # of rows and columns are the same.  What
;   this means is that in order to size the banks we have to go through the sizing routine twice:  once with
;   the memory controller addressing the SIMMS in standard mode, and once in wide mode. (Note:  The YMCA ERS
;   has this complicated roadmap to follow in order to size the memory.  After reviewing and looking at the
;   DRAMs we support I determined that we can size the memory by making the two passes (standard and wide) and
;   then comparing the nibble sizes for each bank and taking the largest one).  One has to be careful because
;   the standard/wide mode is programmed by bank pair:  0/2, 1/3, 4/6, and 5/7.  Any bank can be populated, thus
;   have to watch out for nibble sizes of 0.  Well, enough of this.  FAU 10/21/92

; Given the start and end of a bank of memory, this routine finds the last location
; within the bank which can be written to (including wrap).  Then it trims this back,
; checking for wrap. On exit, it sets a0 = actual size of unique RAM found in the bank,
; (0 if no RAM found), and the low nibble of d5 contains n where bank size = 2^(n-1)*chunk size
; for n > 0, and bank size = 0 for n=0.
;
; This routine assumes that the data cache is OFF.  The addresses passed in
; must be on page boundaries, where the page size is in D0.
